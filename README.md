# Binary-Arithmetic-Expression-EvaluatorUsing-BST
This project implements a binary arithmetic expression evaluator using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The program reads arithmetic expressions in infix notation from an input file, converts them to postfix notation, constructs an expression tree, and evaluates the result using the tree structure
