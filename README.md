# 🔢 Binary Arithmetic Expression Evaluator using BST 🌳

> 📐 **C Language Project** for evaluating complex arithmetic expressions using Binary Expression Trees (BET) and stack-based infix to postfix conversion.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project allows users to **read**, **analyze**, and **evaluate** arithmetic expressions with the power of data structures like **binary trees** and **stacks**. It's perfect for students, CS enthusiasts, and anyone curious about how expression evaluation works under the hood.

📚 It supports:
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`
- Parentheses & operator precedence
- Tree-based evaluation
- File-based input/output

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Read arithmetic expressions from a file  
✅ Convert expressions from **infix** ➜ **postfix** notation  
✅ Construct a **Binary Expression Tree**  
✅ Evaluate the expression tree  
✅ Display expressions and results  
✅ Save output results to a file  
✅ Interactive console menu

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input**: You provide a file containing infix expressions.
2. **Processing**:
   - Convert infix ➜ postfix (using operator precedence and stack)
   - Build expression tree from postfix
   - Evaluate the tree recursively
3. **Output**: View results on screen or save them to a file.

## 🗂️ Input File Format

Each line = one arithmetic expression (in infix notation), like:
